Desciription of project:
    This is an app that when people in the world want someone to help
    them with their car problems, they can:
        click the map
        assign their name
        write a description of their needs
        and add marker to map for everyone to see
    
    You may click exisitng markers on the map to see what people have
    currently added to map

    You may delete mark after clicking a marker to remove the marker from map
        This will add it to helped databse

    When showing all markers, you may also click someones name and it will zoom on the 
    map where that person is

    The Helped List is a list of all previous people have been helped
        For exmaple, when someone removes a marker, i assume they have been helped
        so their name and current time of mark remove is added to helped database and 
        display on web

        Click Clear Helped List to clear this databse of previous helped people

    with // COPIED CODE
    For implementing google maps and working with methods involving google maps,
    I heavily require the use of documentation for this
